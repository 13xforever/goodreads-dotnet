# Goodreads.Tests Project

This project contains mostly integration tests of the clients directly to the Goodreads API. 
They use [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) for the test harness and tests are structured 
following [Phil Haack's blog post](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/01/02/structuring-unit-tests.aspx/).
